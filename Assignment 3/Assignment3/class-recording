There can be project 4.
Project 3 deadline april 4th or may 4th.

Project-3:-
mealamount-100 rows
mealdata - 51 rows
take 51 rows in mealamount and ignore rest.

Ground truth:-
all values are less than equal to 100 grams,so form 6 clusters.

Feature extraction:-
Change features
Goal - determine meal size.
features which proposinatly increase with mean in take.
normalize max value with min value.
(max value - cgm(t=0)) - good feature.

more meal more insulin, which decreases glucose value.
CGM velocity for first 30 to 45 min.
first 6-10 samples.

more calories more time to stabilize so more width.

PCA is not mandatory.

We are working on real world example so we dont know how many features to use or what is good accuracy. Complexity of project is very high.

not all the features work.

If the cgm vlaues is decreasing it is a fake meal. For fake meal we need to extract width by width from threshold and t=0.  

if DBSCAN got 3 clusters take largest do biescting k means, or largest cluster do DBSCAN.

We can have noise points. we will have noise points.

Use ground truth to decide which cluster it belongs.
What if there are two majority.
Two ways- Just choose one or equally divide.
If two clusters have same majority. combine and then divide the clusters or keep one cluster empty.

To check accuracy we need to do KNN validation.
80% data we got clusters.
take remaining 20% data use some distance metric. Calculate euclidian distance with k nearest examples by using features, Then figure out which one is the majority and add it to that cluster. Check it with ground truth.

Calculate (correct prediction/all data).

Grading mechanism:-
2 scripts - 1st figures out cluster of 80%, 2nd script KNN which returns 100*2 clusters.
sir has ground truth based on accuracy he gives score.

KNN has to be done for 20% also.

We need to do SSe only to divide clusters in DBSCAN.
